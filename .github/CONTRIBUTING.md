# Contributing

You can contribute to this repository in several ways.

## Contributions

### Improve Documentation

Since this is a very early version of the repository, any additions to existing documentation are GREATLY appreciated.

### Give Feedback

If you feel strongly about a proposed design or feature, or are interested in influencing the roadmap of features, let us know.

### Write Code

Adding tests, eliminating defects, implementing features are all fantastic ways to contribute. Of course, with prior discussion and approval.

## Terminology/Tips

We have very specific terminology when dealing with contributions, specifically bugs. This is to minimize confusion between contributors when discussing code.

- Defect: incorrect program *code*
- Infection: incorrect program *state*

The infection propagates, causing a failure.

- Failure: an observable incorrect program behavior or program execution

Failures are also called "issues" or "problems".

When bug-hunting, remember the TRAFFIC principle:

- **T**rack the problem
- **R**eproduce
- **A**utomate
- **F**ind origins
- **F**ocus
- **I**solate
- **C**orrect
